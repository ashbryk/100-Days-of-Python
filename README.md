# 100 Days of Code - Python Coursework

Welcome to my 100 days of code repository! This is where I document my journey as I learn Python programming over the course of 100 days. The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, share my code, and reflect on what I've learned.

## About

In this repository, I'll be adding daily log files, code snippets, and mini-projects to showcase what I've learned. Each day, I'll update the relevant section in the Table of Contents above, summarizing the key concepts and achievements.

## Progress

- Current focus: Getting started with Python basics, loops, functions, dictionaries and more

## Code Snippets

Throughout the challenge, I'll be sharing code snippets, small projects, and exercises in the `/code` directory. Feel free to check them out and provide feedback.

## Mini-Projects

I plan to complete a series of mini-projects during this course to apply my knowledge. 

## Resources

- I'm following the [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) for in-depth learning.
- The [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge keeps me motivated.
